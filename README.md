# Dynamic-Webserver

This project was worked on in participation of a Web Development course at the University of St. Thomas. The goal of this project is to build a dynamic server that serves data about a specific sustainability topic chosen by the students working on this project. To achieve this goal, we used a variety of technologies and tools, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. We also utilized a database to store and retrieve data related to our sustainability topic. The project required us to learn and apply concepts such as server-side rendering, database management, and responsive design. 

In addition to learning about web development technologies and techniques, this project also allowed us to gain experience working with databases and APIs. By using a database to store and retrieve data, we were able to create a more dynamic and interactive server that could provide up-to-date information on our chosen sustainability topic. We learned how to use APIs to access data from external sources and integrate it into our server. This helped us to create a more comprehensive and informative server that could provide a wide range of information and resources on sustainability. 

Users of this website can learn about sustainability and the ways in which each state contributes to gas consumption. They can explore the various resources and information provided on the server, which is designed to be interactive and dynamic. Users can also use the website to find information about gas consumption in previous decades. By using the website, users can gain a deeper understanding of the importance of sustainability by learning about the amount of gas consumption used monthly, yearly, and by sector.

In addition to the technical skills we gained, working on this project also allowed us to learn more about sustainability and the importance of environmental conservation. We conducted research on our chosen topic and used that knowledge to inform the design and content of our server. By the end of the project, we had developed a deeper understanding of the topic and the ways in which we can all play a role in promoting sustainability.

Throughout the project, we worked collaboratively as a team, dividing tasks and supporting each other as we encountered challenges and worked towards our shared goal. We were able to draw on the diverse skills and perspectives of each team member, which helped us to create a dynamic and comprehensive server.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that allowed us to combine our technical skills with our passion for sustainability as well as providing us valuable experience in working with databases and APIs, which are essential tools in the field of web development.
