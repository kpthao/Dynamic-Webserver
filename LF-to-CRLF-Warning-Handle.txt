When setting up the repository I ran across some following errors: 

warning: in the working copy of 'public/js/vendor.js', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it

The following link discusses how to set up your machine based on what operating system you are using 
so fewer errors will occur when commit and pulling from a repository.
